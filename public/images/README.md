# Bishop Image Update

The file `bishop-francisco-javier-acero.jpg` needs to be replaced with the correct image of Bishop Francisco Javier Acero as provided by @pacomonroy.

The component is already configured with `object-top` CSS class to focus on the upper half of the image when displayed in the circular frame.

Current dimensions needed: approximately 320x320 pixels for optimal display in the circular frame.

Note: Waiting for the correct bishop image file to be provided due to network access restrictions.
